# UI Extensions â€“ Dev Server

Development server to run and test your HubSpot UI Extensions.

## Overview
This package contains the cli for running HubSpot UI extensions locally, as well as running a production build for debugging purposes.

### Help
If for any reason you need help with the `ui-extensions-dev-server` you can access the help menu in a few ways:

- `hs-ui-extensions-dev-server`
- `hs-ui-extensions-dev-server -h`
- `hs-ui-extensions-dev-server --help`

### Local Development
Prompts you which of your extensions you would like to run in local dev mode. Once you have made your selection, it sets up a watcher on the entry point file for that project as well as any child files.  Any changes to those files will trigger a local build which will bundle your code and output the bundle in a `dist/` directory inside of your current working directory.  To initiate local dev mode in the browser, you just need to navigate to the CRM where your the deployed version of your card lives.  The browser will detect that you have the dev server running, and make the connection on your behalf.

| Action | Command |
| - | - |
| Standard Local Dev | `hs-ui-extensions-dev-server dev` |
| Bypass Prompt | `hs-ui-extensions-dev-server dev --extension MyEntryPointFile.jsx` <br /> `hs-ui-extensions-dev-server dev -e MyEntryPointFile.jsx`|

### Production Build
This should not be required in the standard development workflow. It is there to aid debugging the output of an extension.  This command will run a build similar to what we will run when these extensions are uploaded.  The output will be written into a `dist/` directory in the current working directory.

| Action | Command |
| - | - |
| Build All Extensions | `hs-ui-extensions-dev-server build` |
| Build a single extension | `hs-ui-extensions-dev-server build --extension MyEntryPointFile.jsx` <br /> `hs-ui-extensions-dev-server build -e MyEntryPointFile.jsx`|
